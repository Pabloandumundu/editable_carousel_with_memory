The content of the carousel can be edited (edit an element, add new element and erase an element of the carousel cycle). The changes made is saved on user browser via LocalStorage, there is also option to restore default elements.

Each carousel element includes a citation, the name of the author and a link to an image of the author (that is shown in the carousel).
